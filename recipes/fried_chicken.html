    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>7g sachet dried active yeast</li>
        <li>1 tsp caster sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (225g) strong (baker’s) flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (130g) good-quality pasta sauce</li>
        <li>150g fior di latte or 2 bocconcini, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the pizza dough, place 150ml lukewarm water in a bowl. Sprinkle over yeast and sugar, then whisk with a fork. Stand at room temperature for 15 minutes until bubbles appear on the surface.
        </li>
        <li>Sift flour and 1 1/2 tsp salt into a bowl. Make a well in the centre, then add yeast mixture and mix with oiled hands until the dough comes together in a ball. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead for 10 minutes until smooth and elastic (or use an electric mixer with a dough hook attachment). Place in an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Stand in a warm place for 1 hour until doubled in size.
        </li>
        <li>On a floured surface, gently roll dough into a 3mm-thick rectangle (you don’t want to expel all the air from the dough). Transfer to an oiled baking tray, cover with a tea towel and stand in a warm spot for a further 30 minutes until slightly risen.
        </li>
        <li>Spread the tomato sauce over base, leaving a 2cm border. Top with the cheese and your choice of toppings. Bake the pizzas for 8-10 minutes until cooked and golden, then slice and serve with rocket and basil or pesto and watercress. 
        </li>
    </ol>
